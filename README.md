## :pushpin: About 
__Isles Assault__ - ___Online multiplayer browser game about warfare between different military vehicles classes___. It is the result of crossing the previously popular: ___Agar.io___, ___Slither.io___, ___Diep.io___ and the fairly well-known War Thunder game. The top view was inherited from .io games, as in War Thunder, you can play for 3 main classes of vehicle: __tanks__, __ships__, __planes__, I added __airship__ and __air-carrier__ from myself. There is no plot or script in the game, all we know is that there is a world war, it began in the __early 30s__. On the battlefield there are multi-towered tanks, airships, biplanes and other curiosities of that time. 

__Why isles ?__ - Because it sounds well and they are the only locations where all vehicle classes can cross.

### :bookmark: History
I started to develop this game more than _2 years ago_, it was just experiment, project for fun, which was growing. Now I am more serious about game, my skills and knowledge has grown since that time.

Because when I started the project, I was newbie in programming and web-programming. I made some strange and irrational decisions, which now interfere. I am going to refactor it.

## :wrench: Mods and community servers
I wanted the game to be open-source, for random users would make custom servers, own mods and maps. So, I already made simple system, which allows mods and custom servers. 
> [!WARNING]
> Now it's possible, but I don't recommend you to do it yet, because there is so much code to refactor, many things can be changed.
#### So all information about mods, custom map and servers will be added later.
